# TizenWearableWebCommon
Tizen Wearable Web application common components

Introduction
I've developed tizen apps since Gear 2.0. And now I want to share some of my code base, mostly common for my apps. If someone is still interested in Web apps coding, you can freely use this codes.

Now codes are not well documented, but I will add comments, guides and screens.

Please, don't be rude - I hate javascript development and if you want to support very old devices, you have to stay old javascript.

All codes works from Gear 1 till Galaxy Watch Active, so main purpose is backward compatibility.
